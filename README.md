# Serious-BDDs
The Project is in two parts, both focused on network repair applications, since these exercise a lot of the power of a good BDD package. We will write and exercise kbdd scripts to complete this Project.

# Network Gate Repair
Consider this logic network:

We are showing just the carry chain (from carry-in “cin” to carry-out “cout”) for a 4 bit adder, this is a more sophisticated architecture called a carry-bypass adder. We believe the highlighted gate labeled “?” has been implemented incorrectly. Our job is repair this network and tell the proper gate.
